<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logic of Copying Strategies and Position Size Calculations</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When copying a strategy, your position size is calculated based on an equity to equity ratio. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your equity is calculated based on the amount of funds which have been added to your Copy Trading Account which was designated for following the strategy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of an open position may be adjusted in the event that the position size is modified by the Strategy Provider, due to calculation based on the equity to equity ratio, this affects only the corresponding position to the one adjusted by the Strategy Provider. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you add or remove funds from the Copy Trading Account or the Strategy Provider adds or removes funds from the account used to provide the strategy then positions will be recalculated according to equity to equity ratio.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exception to the above rules is the situation where according to the equity to equity ratio, your position size would be below the minimum allowed trade size or above the maximum allowed trade size, those exceptions are;</span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your position size is calculated to be below the minimum size allowed by your broker, it will be opened, but rounded up to the nearest minimum volume step allowed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your position size is calculated to be above the maximum size allowed by your broker, no position will be opened. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pending Orders as well as protection orders (Stop Loss and Take Profit) are not copied to your account as they are placed by the Strategy Provider. However, when those orders are executed on the Strategy Provider’s account and results in opening or closing position(s), it will also result in opening or closing the corresponding position(s) on your account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cTrader Copy does not guarantee that position(s) will be copied for you. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results are not guaranteed and may not match those of the Strategy Provider for the following reasons;</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entry and exit prices of your positions differ to those of the Strategy Provider.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of your positions differ to those of the Strategy Provider.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commissions you pay to your broker differ to those of the Strategy Provider.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your broker does not offer the same symbols which are being traded in the strategy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You did not have enough margin to follow some of the orders placed in the strategy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have a different Stop-Out Level causing your account to be stopped out, while the Strategy Provider continues to trade. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when you start and stop copying a strategy</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you start copying a strategy, all open positions in the strategy will also be opened in your Copy Trading Account with entry prices according to the current market price, unless you start copying when the market is closed, which in this case will mean your positions will be opened next time the market opens, depending on the symbol and its trading sessions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you stop copying a strategy your positions in the Copy Trading Account will be immediately closed, unless you stop copying when the market is closed, which in this case will mean your positions will be closed next time the market opens, depending on the symbol and its trading sessions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unrealized copying commissions will be charged once all positions have been closed. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing and divesting in strategies</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strategy can have a minimum investment requirement and you must allocate at least that amount in order to follow the strategy.</span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimum investment requirement is set in the account currency of the Strategy Provider’s account. For your convenience, you can see the amount converted to your account currency according to the current conversion rate.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can increase as well as decrease the amount that you allocate to a strategy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you will not be able to remove the funds allocated to a Copy Trading Account which is used to follow a strategy if it will cause the Equity to fall below the minimum investment requirement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To withdraw the full amount, you will need to stop copying the strategy, which will also cause all open positions to be closed. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fees</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy providers are able to determine their own fees to be charged to users copying their strategy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy providers can charge copiers using one or all of the following methods;</span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance Fee</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance fee is paid as percentage of realized and unrealized profits generated by the Strate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gy. It is charged at the end of calculation period, one month. It is also charged at the moment you remove funds or stops copying the strategy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance fee</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is subject to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Water Marks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. High Water Mark principle ensures that you do not charged twice for the same performance.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management Fee</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management fee is a periodic payment that is paid to a Strategy Provider regardless Strategy performance. The Management fee is set by the Strategy Provider as an annual percentage of your Equity. It is accrued daily and charged at the end of calculation period, one month. It is also charged at the moment you remove funds or stops copying the strategy. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume Fee</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume fee is applied to each position, according to the size of the position followed, the fee is charged on opening and closing the position, just like they would be when your Broker charges trading commissions. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of Copy Trading Account</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copy Trading Account is used to hold the amount of funds you want to allocate to a strategy. The amount of funds in the account is the basis of the equity to equity ratio concept.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Copy Trading Account cannot be used for your own trading and you cannot modify the positions in the account. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copy Trading Account allow you to view the trading history and performance of the strategy the account is being used to follow. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copy Trading Account can only be used to follow one strategy at a time. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when a Strategy Provider stops their Strategy.</span>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy Providers can stop providing their Strategy at any moment. In this case you will stop following that strategy automatically and open positions that were copied will be closed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positions will only be closed if the market is open, if the market is closed, positions will only be closed when the market reopens.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All unrealized copying commissions will be charged in the same way as if you decide to stop copying strategy by yourself.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fees paid for copying
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a follower, you pay the fees you consent to when you start following a strategy.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">If Strategy Providers do not charge for their strategy then pay anything.</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12.7. If a Signal Provider stops their strategy all open positions which you have mirrored from them will be closed. If you stop following a strategy all open positions which you have mirrored will be closed.</span></p>

<p><strong>14. CTRADER AUTOMATE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">cTrader has a feature called cTrader Automate (formerly cAlgo), which is a part of cTrader Desktop platform. Using cTrader Automate developers can create custom cBots (trading robots) and indicators, which are pieces of executable code that are running inside cTrader Desktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>14.1.</strong> The difference between two types of executables is that a cBot can make trades on a users account and indicators can’t. Both cBots and indicators can access current user data:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account number</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account balance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">List of open positions, pending orders and trading history</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>14.2.</strong> A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developer can request extended permissions for a cBot or indicator from the following set of possible permissions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No permissions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">File System</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registry</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Access</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permissions can be combined together, for example a cBot might request permission to File system and Internet access.</span></p>
<p><strong>14.3. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Permissions is the default permission set and it is used mostly for cBots and indicators. When a cBot or indicator is launched with this permission set, cTrader won’t ask for any confirmation from you. Any other permission set requires confirmation from you when it is launched for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>14.4.</strong> cBots are able to perform a trading activity on your account and that can result is financial losses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotware holds no responsibility for any actions of the third party service taken after you have granted to it access to get account information and/or trade on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>14.5.</strong> Depending on the permissions which you give, a third-party may be able to retrieve any information or perform any action from the computer you are using to run your cBot or indicator, not only the information available in your cTrader account.</span></p>
